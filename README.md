Predict the last rating of an active user i.e. for user with 5 or more reviews, to hold out their final review (by date) and make a prediction on the rating of this final review. 

<b>Objective</b>

The objective is to predict the last rating of each active user. Three models have been implemented and user-item bias baseline model have also been implemented to compare how well the models are predicting. The 3 models implemented are ALS, deep learning model using embedding layers and Factorization Machine(LightFM).
